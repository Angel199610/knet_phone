# Step 1: Build the React app

# Use an official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the entire project to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the React app using a lightweight web server

# Use an Nginx image to serve the static files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build folder from the previous step to the Nginx html folder
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
